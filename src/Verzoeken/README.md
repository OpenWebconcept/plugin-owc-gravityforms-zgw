# Verzoeken

This directory contains code written during the VNG fieldlab (19-01-26 / 20-01-26).
Since the development of the Zaken (ZGW) APIs is nearing completion, we are currently exploring and proof-of-concepting the Verzoeken module.
The current structure and implementation are intentionally minimal. A lot of specifications and responsibilities are still in motion, and major pieces of the puzzle are not fully defined yet. To avoid unnecessary refactoring work, we are keeping the implementation simple and flexible for now.
Further refinement, abstraction and alignment with the final ZGW specs will follow once things stabilize.
